# Workflow Modal

> The `WorkflowModal` is a React component designed to render a full screen modal that slides in and out of the viewport.

> Provides a flexible way to display content in a modal overlay.

> Useful for showing additional information, settings, or any content that should not always be visible on the page.

> Utilizes `framer-motion` for animations and a custom `Portal` component for rendering the panel outside the regular DOM hierarchy.

> The panel can be opened and closed programmatically by setting the `isOpen` prop to `true` or `false`.

> The panel can be closed by clicking on the overlay or by pressing the `ESC` key.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `id` (optional): A string that specifies the unique identifier for the workflow modal. Useful for accessibility purposes and for targeting the panel with CSS or JavaScript.
- `title`: A `React.ReactNode` that represents the title of the workflow modal. This can be a string or any React component.
- `footer` (optional): A `React.ReactNode` that will be rendered as the footer of the panel. This is useful for adding actions or additional information related to the content of the flyout.
- `children`: A `React.ReactNode` representing the content of the workflow modal. This is the main body of the panel where your custom content will be placed.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { WorkflowModal } from 'sds-ui';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Open Panel</button>
      <WorkflowModal id="my-flyout-panel" title="My Panel Title" isOpen={isOpen} onClose={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
        <p>This is the content of my workflow modal.</p>
      </WorkflowModal>
    </>
  );
};
```
