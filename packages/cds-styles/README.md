```text
pnpm install
```

## Project structure

Project file/folder structure:

- `/src` contains all related SCSS partial files for all Stretto brands
- `/lib` contains the compiled CSS files (This workspace is configured to output expanded and prefixed CSS)
- Check the `package.json` file for the build/dev scripts used to generate the compiled CSS

## Editing the SCSS files

â€¢ Edit the SCSS files as needed and run pnpm lint to adhere to the stylelint config and Design System guidelines.
