# Migrating to CDS-UI v9

## Breaking Changes

The main breaking change in v9 is the requirement to import the component styles in the root of your application. Previously all component
styles were injected into the head of the document, this lead to incosistent errors depending on the consuming application's architecture/configuration.
This change ensures that styles are only loaded once and improves performance. They're also minified and tree-shaken to reduce bundle size.

### Component Styles Import

In v9, you need to import the component styles in your main CSS file or at the root of your application. This is a one-time setup and will ensure that all components are styled and themed correctly.

### Example

```css
// Import the main theme CSS bundle from the cds-styles v9 package (Available themes are: bcc, tsc, and core each have a light and dark theme included)
@import '@stretto/cds-styles/bcc';
// Import the main component CSS bundle
@import '@stretto/cds-ui/component-styles';
```

```jsx
// Import components in your jsx or tsx file
import { Button } from '@stretto/cds-ui';
```
